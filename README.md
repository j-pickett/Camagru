Camagru is my React/Firebase/Node project that is meant to be an "instagram clone". The user uploads photos taken with the hardware's camera, and can then post on the site and interact with other users by comments and likes. Although this is still a WIP it is nearly finished. 

Camagru is now hosted on Heroku! Visit it here - https://camagru-42tty.herokuapp.com

## EDIT: I NEED TO UPDATE THE IMAGES OF THE SITE, IT IS NOW FINISHED AND FULLY FUNCTIONING. I STILL PLAN ON ADDING MORE FEATURES

Here are some screenshots of what it looks like so far:


This is the Sign in page where you will be redirected until you make an account to access the rest of the site's features.

Once signed in you can visit the rest of the site, such as the home page which currently displays the messages of the site ie the forum.

Your account page will allow you to reset/change your password and let you link your social media accounts for faster login.

Finally the landing page where you take your photos with the device's camera and can add stickers to the image then post on the site.

There is also an admin page but has sensitive details I don't want to share in a screenshot :)



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
